## Bug report

**Title**: Full name input box has no corresponding label

**Description**: The full name input box has no corresponding label attribute. This means users who navigate the site using the keyboard will not receive the necessary information from their screenreader when they focus on this element. This can cause confusion for the user as they will not know what they need to input into the box. 

**Steps to reproduce**: 
1. spin up the environment following the steps in the repo
2. Navigate to the page via any browser
3. Right-click on the **Full Name** input box and click inspect
4. There will be no label attribute in the Full Name element

**Expected Outcome**: Element should have correct label attribute 

**Actual Outcome**: Element has no label attribute

**How often is this defect observed**: Every visit to the page

**Priority**: To be triaged
